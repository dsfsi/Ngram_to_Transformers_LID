## Project Description 
-----------

This Github Repository contains datasets extracted from Vuk'zenzele () used to train various Language identification (LID) models such as N-grams, Machine Learning models (e.g SVM, Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbor, and Naive Bayes), and Transformer models (BERT, DistilBERT, mBERT, RemBERT, XLMr, AfroLM, Afro-XLMR, AfriBERTa, Serengeti, etc). The repo also contains code on how to use available LID models such as GlotLID, OpenLID, AfroLIF, and CLD V3.

## Getting Started
-----------
_This section provides the necessary information for a user to be able to run the code locally._

### Prerequisites 

All code is developed using Python.  : 

- Python 3.* 

### Installation 

1. Run the requirements.txt to install all the required libraries, modules, and packages.  

```
Run
pip install -r requirements.txt 
If all dependencies did not install successfully, or having compatability issues, the dependencies you need are:
sklearn
pandas
seaborn
matplotlib
numpy 
torch
transformers
nltk
tqdm
seqeval

```

### Usage 

All code and datasets is contained inside the src folder: 

1. To use the code , follow the steps: 

```
* For each model category (N-grams, ML, or Transformers) ensure all dependencies are installed
* For each Categoory of models there is script folder  (E.g LID_Toold/scripts). This folder contains a bash file that runs the appropriate python file five times and saves results in a destination folder (may need to change the destination folder)
* To run the bash simply run nohup bash 'script_name.sh' > 'output_text_file.txt' & . This line ensures the execution does not stop even if termibal is closed.
* Once run is complete all output files, plots, etc, will be saved to a destination folder for you to view.
* NB: For files with no script, you may ned to run the python file directly

```
