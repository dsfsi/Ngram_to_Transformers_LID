"Our national response has been driven by an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) chaired and ably led by the Minister of Health, Dr Zweli Mkhize.The manner in which the IMC and the support teams have responded to this emergency has been both exemplary and reassuring, particularly in helping to quell public panic.

"During the first full week of the nation-wide lockdown to combat the coronavirus pandemic that is devastating the world, we were grateful for good news that brought us joy and hope at this difficult and uncertain time.
",eng
"The 114 South Africans who were evacuated from Wuhan in China some weeks ago ended their quarantine and were reunited with their families.
",eng
"They have all tested negative for the virus and are in good health and good spirits.
",eng
"For months, they had been in lockdown, first in Wuhan for some 51 days and then in Polokwane for 14 days.
",eng
"They were unable to be with their loved ones, unable to leave their living quarters and uncertain about when their ordeal would end.
",eng
"When we add the remaining 17 days that South Africa will be under lockdown they will have been under lockdown for 82 days.
",eng
"It was wonderful to spend time with this diverse group of South Africans made up of all ages, languages and backgrounds.
",eng
"I was impressed by their resilience and courage and by their determination to remain healthy.
",eng
"They have come from the epicentre of the coronavirus in Wuhan in China and have seen the devastating impact this virus is wreaking on human life.
",eng
"It is not surprising to hear them say that they are on a mission to safe-guard the health of those around them.
",eng
"Now their patience and fortitude has been rewarded, because they are returning to their families.
",eng
"Their return home was made possible by a great many people who went to great lengths to make this repatriation operation a success.
",eng
"As a nation, we are extremely grateful to the Government and the people of China for taking such good care of our citizens, and for their assistance in organising their repatriation.
",eng
"It is significant that several of the South Africans in Wuhan were on study scholarships from the Chinese government; an act of generosity that is deeply appreciated.
",eng
"We are grateful too to all the people who were involved in the operation, from the SAA flight crew to the medical team to the police and soldiers who brought them home.
",eng
"Each and every one of them stepped forward to take responsibility for the safety and well-being of others.
",eng
"They were prepared to undertake a difficult and dangerous mission and to subject themselves to quarantine.
",eng
"And now, they all tell me, they are ready for their next mission.
",eng
"I wish to thank the staff and management of the Ranch Hotel in Polokwane, who took great care of the returnees.
",eng
"They were prepared to play their part in our national effort to overcome this disease.
",eng
"Everyone involved in this operation has done South Africa proud.
",eng
"The experience of the South Africans in Wuhan demonstrates the effectiveness – and the necessity – of a state of lockdown.
",eng
"It was due to the drastic actions that the Chinese government took to con tain the disease in the city of Wuhan, that all of our people were able to return uninfected and healthy.
",eng
"Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in the province of Hubei, had more than 50,000 infections.
",eng
"Now, after more than two months after stringent lockdown measures were put in place, the province has had fewer than 20 new cases in the past two weeks.
",eng
"The containment of the disease in Wuhan City, in Hubei Province and in other places across China required a massive and extraordinary effort.
",eng
"It involved drastic restrictions on daily life and is having a severe impact on the Chinese economy.
",eng
"Other countries that have taken similar measures are having greater success in managing the spread of the disease than countries that have been slower to respond.As the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide grows to over 700,000 and the number of deaths exceeds 33,000, we can draw lessons from these countries.It is now abundantly clear that the most effective way for a society to contain the spread of the disease is for the population to remain at home and physically isolated from each other for at least several weeks.
",eng
"And it is important that this lockdown and all other emergency measures are both strictly adhered to and consistently enforced.
",eng
"As the South Africans from Wuhan can testify, such restrictions on daily life, on movement and on ordinary human contact are extremely difficult to endure.
",eng
"In the South African context, a lockdown brings additional hardship and strain, and we are doing everything within our means to lessen the impact on our people.
",eng
"But the lesson from the South Africans in Wuhan is that a lockdown works.
",eng
"It shows that if we strictly observe the rules in place to stop the virus spreading, we will be able to bring infection rates down.
",eng
"It shows that if we cooperate with health authorities in doing what we have to do, we won’t be just saving our own lives but those around us too.
",eng
"The story of our South African returnees from Wuhan should give us encouragement and hope in the difficult weeks that lie ahead.
",eng
"Their story tells us that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, that if we stay the course, that if we remain disciplined and respect the lockdown, that if we work together, we will overcome.

""" I am convinced , that the congress will tackle these proposals , "" he said .
",eng
"The ODS , a party in which Klaus often tries to emulate the style of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , has been in control of Czech politics since winning general elections in 1992 .

"Poland said on Friday that Swiss bank accounts , which in many cases belonged to Polish Jews who died in the Holocaust , were used in debt settlements between the two countries after the World War Two .
",eng
"Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati , unveiling first findings of a special government commission , said that in 1970s the then communist Poland received 460,000 Swiss francs from the accounts .

""" In 1970s , Poland received from unclaimed accounts in Switzerland a sum of 460,000 francs .
",eng
"What was its right ( to the money ) ...I do not know , "" Rosati told a news conference .
",eng
"Switzerland stands accused by Senator Alfonse D'Amato , chairman of the powerful U.S. Senate Banking Committee , of agreeing to give money to Poland from unclaimed bank accounts of Polish citizens , as part of an accord on compensating Swiss nationals whose assets had been seized in communist Poland .
",eng
"Many of these citizens were Jews murdered during the war , when Nazi German invaders killed most of Poland 's 3.5 million Jews .
",eng
"Rosati did not say whether the payment in 1970s was part of the 1949 agreement between Warsaw and Switzerland on compensation to Swiss citizens whose assets were seized by the Soviet-imposed communists authorities after World War Two .
",eng
""" I expect that the commission will finish gathering information within two to three weeks and then more details will be provided , "" Rosati said .
",eng
"Rosati confirmed that the 1949 agreement had provided for granting Switzerland about 53 million francs and most of this sum was repaid with coal exports .

"He said , however , that Switzerland did get about 16,000 francs from the so-called "" dead accounts "" as part of the compensation .
",eng
""" About 16,000 francs were seized from accounts of four or five Polish citizens , whose data we do not precisely know .

"Polish brewer Zywiec 's 1996 profit slump may last into next year due in part to hefty depreciation charges , but recent high investment should help the firm defend its 10-percent market share , the firm 's chief executive said .
",eng
"Company President Jean van Boxmeer told Reuters in an interview on Friday that the firm , whose net profit fell 77 percent in the first 10 months of 1996 despite a 30-percent rise in sales , might only post slightly better profits in 1997 before having a chance to make a more significant turnaround .
",eng
"So far this year Zywiec , whose full name is Zaklady Piwowarskie w Zywcu SA , has netted six million zlotys on sales of 224 million zlotys .
",eng
"Van Boxmeer would not say how much higher 1997 profits or market share could be but said sales of leading Polish brewers should rise as the country 's young urban professionals gradually switch from vodka to beer .
",eng
""" The perspective on growth is such that reasonably we can think that somewhere between 65 and 80 litres per year is certainly reachable , "" van Boxmeer said on Polish per-capita beer consumption , currently around 40 litres .
",eng
"He said the 65-80-litre level could be reached in the next ten years and make Poland , with its 40-million population , Europe 's third largest beer market after Germany and Britain .
",eng
"Van Boxmeer said Poland 's top five brewers , which produce about 55 percent of the country 's beer , could all raise market share as some of the numerous small brewers fall to competition from the large brewers with foreign investors .
",eng
"Zywiec is 31.8-percent owned by Heineken while Carlsberg has the same amount in Okocim .
",eng
"Earlier this year South African Breweries Ltd ( SAB ) bought strategic stakes in the unlisted Lech and Tychy brewers , which together hold more than 20 percent of the market , and Australia 's Brewpole BV has a controlling stake in Poland 's larges t brewery , Elbrewery Company Ltd. ( EB ) .
",eng
"Van Boxmeer said the tough competition had prevented Zywiec from raising prices in line with inflation , which had added to the pressure on the firm 's margins .
",eng
"He said advertising costs would also increase in the fight for market share .
",eng
"But he said the company 's investment of more than $ 100 million already this decade , largely in production , would help position it to compete with such competitors as brewers from the neighbouring Czech Republic .
",eng
"Some analysts say cheaper but high-quality Czech imports could invade Poland once tariffs for CEFTA countries are lifted in 1998 , but van Boxmeer says such a threat might be exaggerated despite the Czech beer market 's overcapacity .
",eng
""" I think Polish consumers in general are quite proud of their beers -- and I 'm speaking about all the brands -- and as we make good beers ...
",eng
"I think that this fidelity to our beers is a factor which can limit the Czech beers , "" he said .
",eng
"Van Boxmeer said Zywiec had its eye on Okocim , which has said it would start producing Carlsberg beer next year , but that Zywiec 's potential production of Heineken was a medium-term possibility rather than a short-term one .
",eng
"He said his firm would be better off concentrating on its leading brand , Zywiec Full Light , which accounts for 85 percent of sales and is the country 's largest-selling brand .
",eng
""" You will not win the war of the Polish beer market with imported international brands , "" van Boxmeer said , adding that Heineken would remain an up-market import in Poland .
",eng
"Van Boxmeer also said Zywiec would be boosted by its recent shedding of soft drinks which only accounted for about three percent of the firm 's overall sales and for which 7.6 million zlotys in provisions had already been made .

"Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang added that even if the conditions were met by both airlines , final clearance would hinge on an open skies deal between Britain and the United States to liberalise trans-Atlantic air traffic , which would create greater competition on the routes .

"Lang said he supported conditions proposed by Britain 's Office of Fair Trading , which was asked to examine the case last month .
",eng

"His comments came just minutes after the latest set of open skies talks ended in London with no deal signed .
",eng
"Industry sources said there was no new date for fresh talks and blamed the deadlock on uncertainty over whether the British Airways-American deal would be cleared .
",eng
"The conditions for clearance of the alliance were that British Airways and American drop 168 slots at London Heathrow airport , the busiest in Europe .
",eng
"American 's parent , AMR Corp. , said it did not view the terms as a "" deal breaker . ""

"However , it called the conditions "" more severe "" than those imposed by other regulatory authorities on similar airline alliances .

"Newmont , in fact , will not benefit from the Santa Fe acquisition on an earnings basis for at least two years , which also limits its capacity to raise its offer .

"Plastic surgery is booming , especially among men , as Brazilians spend much of their new-found wealth on the latest beauty treatments , said the organisers of a four-day international plastic surgery conference that opened on Friday .
",eng
"The number of plastic surgeries in Brazil has jumped 30 percent to an estimated 150,000 this year since an anti-inflation plan was introduced in July 1994 , Farid Hakme , the president of the Brazilian Plastic Surgery Society ( SBCP ) , said .
",eng
"The number of operations on men increased even more -- by 80 percent , from 8,000 in 1994 to 15,000 in 1995 , he said .
",eng
""" Brazil ranks right at the top for plastic surgery with respect to the number of surgeons , the number of patients , number of operations , number of conferences .
",eng
"Our statistics are the highest for everything , "" Hakme said .
",eng
""" We believe the increase in plastic surgeries for men results from the difficulties in the job market .
",eng
"People need to have a more youthful look to compete in the job market , given the profound changes in Latin America 's economy . ""
",eng
"A controlled exchange rate , trade liberalisation and tight monetary policies have also dramatically curbed inflation , making more money available for cosmetic surgery .
",eng
"Brazil has been at the forefront in plastic surgery for decades and is home to one of the most famous surgeons , Ivo Pitangy .
",eng
"There are 6,000 plastic surgeons there , of which 4,500 have qualified to be members of the SBCP .
",eng
"Every year , 500 new plastic surgeons graduate in Brazil and medical students from all over the world come to study there .
",eng
"Hakme attributes Brazil 's fascination with plastic surgery not to excessive vanity but to the country 's mix and match of different races , which can create physical disharmonies . ""
",eng
"What happens is the nose sometimes does n't match the mouth or the buttocks do n't match with the legs , "" he said .
",eng
"Brazil 's most sought-after beauty treatment is liposuction in which fat is sucked away from areas of the body , with about 30,000 operations a year at a cost of $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 each .

"Stomach tucks and breast operations are also popular since the tropical climate calls for flesh-baring fashions , but unlike women elsewhere Brazilians tend to have breast reductions and buttock implants .

"The protest culminated at dawn on Tuesday with several hundred students being detained briefly by police in central Rangoon .

"The street protests were the biggest seen in the capital since the student-led pro-democracry demonstrations of September 1988 when the junta crushed the uprising .

"But the students stressed their protests were non-political and they had no contact with Suu Kyi 's National League for Democracy ( NLD ) .

"K.J. Matthew said at the Asia Rubber Markets meeting here Indian production of natural rubber in 1996/97 will reach 547,000 tonnes against projected demand of 578,000 tonnes , a gap of 31,000 tonnes .
",eng
"For synthetic rubber , production reached 68,200 tonnes in 1995/96 while consumption in the same season hit 134,085 tonnes , Matthew added .
",eng
""" Though schemes designed to realise further increases in the production of natural rubber are being operated successfully , the demand-supply gap is expected to widen , "" he said .
",eng
"Indian synthetic rubber output is not expected to rise significantly in the next season but demand will rise to 145,000 tonnes .
",eng
"Matthew estimates that by the 2000/01 season , the gap between natural rubber output and consumption will rise to 51,000 tonnes and 319,000 tonnes in 2010/11 .
",eng
"Natural rubber production will go up to 695,000 tonnes in 2000/01 against consumption of 746,000 tonnes .
",eng
"In 2010/11 , domestic demand should rise further to 1.233 million tonnes while production will only reach about 914,000 tonnes .
",eng
"One way to bridge the widening gap is to put more land under cultivation which the Rubber Board official estimates will reach 220,000 hectares between now and the year 2003 although Matthew said this may not be possible at this time in India .

"Comments by Japan 's tight-lipped central bank chief and an influential top bureaucrat are further signs that the nation 's authorities want to keep the dollar at current levels , market sources said on Friday .

"In a rare expression of a view on currencies by the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) governor , Yasuo Matsushita was quoted in Japan 's leading economic daily on Friday as saying that he sees no further , immediate fall in the yen .

"This followed a widely watched television appearance late on Thursday by Eisuke Sakakibara , a high-ranking Finance Ministry official , who denied he had said he wants to guide the dollar lower to between 108 and 110 yen .

""" It shows that Sakakibara is not for a stronger dollar either , "" said Sumitomo 's Note .

",eng
"Market participants have kept a close eye on Sakakibara , chief of the ministry 's International Finance Bureau , as a comment he made in November after the dollar hit this year 's high of 114.92 yen pushed the currency down sharply .
",eng
"He had said then that the market 's view on Japan 's economy was too pessimistic and that he believed it was stronger than the market thought .

"Dealers have come to refer to 115 yen as the "" Sakakibara ceiling "" for the dollar following the remark .
",eng
"Adding to the comments by "" Mr Yen "" , as Sakakibara is known for his prominence in the currency market , was BOJ governor Matsushita 's remark .

""" The recent level of the yen exchange rate has been stable , and it does not appear to be moving towards a further depreciation of the yen immediately , so import prices are likely to stabilise at current levels , "" Matsushita said in an interview with the Nihon Keizai Shimbun .

"The court convicted General Antoine Lahd , head of the South Lebanon Army ( SLA ) , of collaborating with Israel with which Lebanon is officially at war .
",eng
"Lahd , a 69-year-old former Lebanese army major-general , heads the 3,000-strong SLA militia which helps Israel hold a border zone in south Lebanon to ward off cross-frontier guerrilla raids on northern Israel .
",eng
"Lahd said a few days after the trial began on February 16 that Lebanese authorities must drop the charges or risk blocking any peace deal with the Jewish state .
",eng
"He said Israel was capable of pressuring Lebanon 's Syrian-backed government to stop the legal pursuit .
",eng
"The charges against Lahd were : forming a hostile army , carrying weapons on Israel 's side , helping Israel strip off a part of Lebanese territory by violence , forming an armed gang , killing or trying to kill Lebanese civilians by artillery shelling and kidnapping Lebanese citizens for long periods .
",eng
"Shortly before Lahd 's trial began , a Beirut military prosecutor charged another 89 former Lebanese army soldiers with collaborating with Israel .
",eng
"No date has been set for the trial of the men , all members of the SLA living in the Israeli-held zone in south Lebanon .
",eng
"Israel and Lahd have repeatedly demanded safety guarantees for the SLA -- a mixed Christian-Shi'ite Moslem force -- which the Jewish states regards as loyal allies .
",eng
"Israel has said the Lebanese army must incorporate the SLA fighters into its ranks as an army brigade as a condition for peace .

"But Lebanese political analysts have said that would be out of the question and Lebanese authorities pre-empted the issue by taking legal action against Lahd .
